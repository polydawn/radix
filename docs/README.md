Lest you be mislead into thinking the content of this repo is perfect,
the Caveats are suggested reading first.  There's room to improve, and if
contributing, Be The Change You Want to See, etc :)

The rest of the guidelines docs should give some getting-started help,
including pointers to existing modules which are (hopefully) a good baseline
example to copy-paste when starting your own new work.

Remember, the rest of the Timeless Stack core tools documentation is online:
