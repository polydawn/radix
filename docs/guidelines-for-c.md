Guidelines for C
================

outline
-------

- building at all
	- autotools typicals
	- base image
		- megalith concession (for now)
	- so far we've only covered how to build things with *no* libraries
- building with library dependencies
	- caveat about the megalith having some libraries
	- suggested library paths
	- jmpeq recursive module authoring
- building and getting output files found
	- and our suggested conventions for how to arrange them
	- first mention of static vs dynamic?
- building with xorigin
	- introduce concept
	- pitch autoconfesque
	- further instructions on getting it in alternative ways
- mention library splays
	- (e.g. what path-agno talk at asg2018 describes in the last half)
	- just a brief mention of future direction.
	- someday we should explore having libraries/utils to assist this pattern.
